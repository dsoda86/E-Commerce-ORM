## Description
Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms has become a necessary part of full-stack web developement.

This e-commerce application is developed using starter code to create a back-end application for an e-commerce site that uses the command line interface (CLI) and object-relational mapping for various methods of data manipulation, storage, and retrieval when using HTTP methods with a RESTUL API.

Users can perform CRUD operations with Insomnia once the application has been started.
